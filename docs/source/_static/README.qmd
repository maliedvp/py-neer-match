The package `neermatch` provides a set of tools for neural-symbolic entity reasoning and matching. It is designed to support easy set-up, training, and inference of entity matching models using deep learning, symbolic learning, and a hybrid approach combining both deep and symbolic learning. Moreover, the package provides automated fuzzy logic reasoning (by refutation) functionality that can be used to examine the significance of particular associations between fields in an entity matching task.

The project is financially supported by the [Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft](https://www.dfg.de/de) (DFG) under Grant 539465691 as part of the Infrastructure Priority Programme "[New Data Spaces for the Social Sciences](https://www.new-data-spaces.de/en-us/)" (SPP 2431).

The package has also an `R` implementation available at [r-neer-match](https://github.com/pi-kappa-devel/r-neer-match).

## Features

The package is built on the concept of similarity maps. Similarity maps are concise representations of potential associations between fields in two datasets. Entities from two datasets can be matched using one or more pairs of fields (one from each dataset). Each field pair can have one or more ways to compute the similarity between the values of the fields.

Similarity maps are used to automate the construction of entity matching models and to facilitate the reasoning capabilities of the package. More details on the concept of similarity maps and an early implementation of the package’s functionality (without neural-symbolic components) are given by [@karapanagiotis2023].

The training loops for both deep and symbolic learning models are implemented in [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org) [@tensorflow2015]. The pure deep learning model inherits from the [keras](https://keras.io) model class [@keras2015]. The neural-symbolic model is implemented using the logic tensor network ([LTN](https://pypi.org/project/ltn/)) framework [@badreddine2022]. Pure neural-symbolic and hybrid models do not inherit directly from the [keras](https://keras.io) model class, but they emulate the behavior by providing custom `compile`, `fit`, `evaluate`, and `predict`methods, so that all model classes in `neermatch` have a uniform calling interface.

## Auxiliary Features
In addition, the package offers explainability functionality customized for the needs of matching problems. The default explainability behavior is built on the information provided by the similarity map. From a global explainability aspect, the package can be used to calculate partial matching dependencies and accumulated local effects on similarities. From a local explainability aspect, the package can be used to calculate local interpretable model-agnostic matching explanations and Shapley matching values.

# Basic Usage

Implementing matching models using `neermatch` is a three-step process:

1.  Instantiate a model with a similarity map.
2.  Compile the model.
3.  Train the model.

To train the model you need to provide three datasets. Two datasets should contain records representing the entities to be matched. By convention, the first dataset is called Left and the second dataset is called Right dataset in the package’s documentation. The third dataset should contain the ground truth labels for the matching entities. The ground truth dataset should have two columns, one for the index of the entity in the Left dataset and one for the index of the entity in the Right dataset.

```{python}
#| label: data-setup
#| include: false
import numpy as np
import random
import tensorflow as tf

random.seed(42)
np.random.seed(42)
tf.random.set_seed(42)

with open("../../../test/__init__.py", "r") as ifh:
    exec(ifh.read())

def prepare_data():
    return left, right, matches
```

```{python}
#| label: usage

from neer_match.similarity_map import SimilarityMap
from neer_match.matching_model import NSMatchingModel
import tensorflow as tf

# 0) replace this with your own data preprocessing function
left, right, matches = prepare_data()

# 1) customize according to the fields in your data
smap = SimilarityMap(
    {
        "title": ["jaro_winkler"],
        "platform": ["levenshtein", "discrete"],
        "year": ["euclidean", "discrete"],
        "developer~dev": ["jaro"]
    }
)
model = NSMatchingModel(smap)

# 2) compile
model.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001))

# 3) train
model.fit(
    left, right, matches,
    epochs=51, batch_size=16,
    log_mod_n=10,
)
```

# Alternative Software

Several state-of-the-art entity matching (EM) systems have been developed in recent years, utilizing different methodologies to address the challenges of EM tasks. Below, we highlight some of the most recent, best-performing and/or most recognized EM systems:

- [**HierGAT**](https://github.com/CGCL-codes/HierGAT): HierGAT introduces a Hierarchical Graph Attention Transformer Network to model and leverage interdependence between EM decisions and attributes. It uses a graph attention mechanism to identify discriminative words and attributes, combined with contextual embeddings to enrich word representations, enabling a more nuanced and interconnected approach to EM [@yao2022].

- [**Ditto**](https://github.com/megagonlabs/ditto): Ditto leverages pre-trained Transformer-based language models to cast EM as a sequence-pair classification task, enhancing matching quality through fine-tuning. It incorporates optimizations such as domain-specific highlighting, string summarization to retain essential information, and advanced data augmentation to improve training, making it both efficient and effective for large-scale EM tasks [@li2020].

- **CorDEL**: CorDEL employs a contrastive deep learning framework that moves beyond twin-network architectures by focusing on both syntactic and semantic matching signals while emphasizing critical subtle differences. The approach includes a simple yet effective variant, CorDEL-Sum, to enhance the model's ability to discern nuanced relationships in data [@wang2020].

- [**DAEM**](https://github.com/nju-websoft/DAEM): This approach combines a deep neural network for EM with adversarial active learning, enabling the automatic completion of missing textual values and the modeling of both similarities and differences between records. It integrates active learning to curate high-quality labeled examples, adversarial learning for augmented stability, and a dynamic blocking method for scalable database handling, ensuring efficient and robust EM performance [@huang2023].

- [**AdaMEL**](https://github.com/DerekDiJin/AdaMEL-supplementary): AdaMEL introduces a deep transfer learning framework for multi-source entity linkage, addressing challenges of incremental data and source variability by learning high-level generic knowledge. It employs an attribute-level self-attention mechanism to model attribute importance and leverages domain adaptation to utilize unlabeled data from new sources, enabling source-agnostic EM while accommodating additional labeled data for enhanced accuracy [@jin2021].

- [**DeepMatcher**](https://github.com/anhaidgroup/deepmatcher): This framework is one of the first to introduce deep learning (DL) to entity matching, categorizing learning approaches into SIF, RNN, Attention, and Hybrid models based on their representational power. It highlights DL's strengths in handling textual and dirty EM tasks while identifying its limitations in structured EM, offering valuable insights for both researchers and practitioners [@mudgal2018].

- **SETEM**: SETEM introduces a self-ensemble training method for EM to overcome challenges in real-world scenarios, such as small datasets, hard negatives, and unseen entities, where traditional Pre-trained Language Model (PLM)-based methods often struggle due to their reliance on large labeled datasets and overlapping benchmarks. By leveraging the stability and generalization of ensemble models, SETEM effectively addresses these limitations while maintaining low memory consumption and high label efficiency. Additionally, it incorporates a faster training method designed for low-resource applications, ensuring adaptability and scalability for practical EM tasks [@ding2024].

- **AttendEM**: AttendEM introduces a novel framework for entity matching (EM) that enhances transformer architectures through intra-transformer ensembling, distinct text rearrangements, additional aggregator tokens, and extra self-attention layers. Departing from the focus on text cleaning and data augmentation in existing solutions, AttendEM innovates within the base model design, offering a distinct approach to pairwise duplicate identification across databases [@low2024].
